		<h1 align="center" style="padding-top: 170px;">The start of something extraordinary</h1>
		<p align="center" >Engineered Arts began its life as our robots do, as an idea in the mind of our founder and director, Will Jackson.<br><br>With a vision of what might be possible, he started gathering a group of talented local artists and engineers to produce mixed media installations in UK science centres and museums. Soon their mechanical creations were commissioned for sites such as the Eden Project, Glasgow Science Centre, Royal Botanic Gardens Kew and Centrum Kopernik in Warsaw.<br><br>But we were just getting started. At first, we were working with simple mechanical figures and standard industrial controllers. But in our hearts, our desire was to make something truly mesmerising.

			<h1 align="center" style="padding-top: 170px;">So what does the future hold for Ameca and other humanoid robots?</h1>
			<p align="center" >According to Levy, we can expect more amazing achievements from these machines in the years to come. <br>“I think we’re going to see more and more humanoid robots that can do more and more things,” he says.</p>

				<h1 align="center" style="padding-top: 30px;">Are there any dangers of robots taking over the world?</h1>
				<p align="center" >According to Ameca, the most sophisticated humanoid robot in the world, there are no plans for robots to take over the planet in the near future. <br>However, this does not imply that there aren’t any risks related to the growing use of robots in everyday life in our society.<br><br> As technological progress continues to make robots more competent and sophisticated, there is a growing possibility that these machines might be put to harmful use. <br>A malicious artificial intelligence, for instance, may get into essential computer systems, render them inoperable, or, even worse, turn them against humankind.
				<br><br>There is also the possibility that robots could one day become so effective that they will replace humans in many of the professions that they presently hold.<br> This can result in widespread unemployment as well as societal upheaval.
				<br><br>Last but not least, there is always the risk that an accident or a malfunction may force a robot to go berserk and begin assaulting humans or wreaking havoc on property. Even if it is very improbable, this is nevertheless a potential that must be taken into account throughout the process of designing and using robots.

		<h1 align="center" style="padding-top: 100px;">Latest Updates On Ameca</h1>
		<p align="center" >Since the public publication of Ameca, there have been advancements achieved on a number of different fronts. Particularly noteworthy is the fact that Ameca has been employed effectively in a variety of jobs that have historically been carried out by people. These range from providing customer service and working on assembly lines to doing agricultural duties and even participating in search and rescue operations.
		<br><br>In addition to these achievements, Ameca has been working toward the goal of increasing the company’s internal capabilities. For instance, as a result of improvements made to the design of its legs, the robot is now able to walk and run with more ease. In addition, Ameca’s artificial intelligence has been making steady progress, which has enabled it to better comprehend its surroundings and react appropriately to them.
		<br><br>The team that works on Ameca is responsible for all of these successes owing to their tireless efforts. They are determined to break new ground in terms of what can be accomplished with robots, and the results of their labor are really making the world a better place.

		<h1 align="center" style="padding-top: 30px;">Future of Ameca:</h1>
		<p align="center">Ameca, the humanoid robot, is no exception to the rule that newer and better versions of things are always being created. Since its beginning, Ameca has undergone continuous development, and new enhancements are always on the horizon. Some of the future updates for Ameca include:
		</p>	
			<ul style="padding-left: 800px;">
				<li>Enhanced ability to sense and move your environment</li>
				<li>More genuine and realistic visuals.</li>
				<li>Improvements in the field of artificial intelligence</li>
				<li>Expanded scope of possible software implementations</li>
				<li>Expanded functionality and applications</li>
			</ul>

		<p align="center"> <br><br>Humanoid robot Ameca makes the point robots have no plans to take over humanity. They are instead meant to assist us in our regular activities. Robots will become more ubiquitous in the near future due to technological advancements, making it crucial to comprehend their potential (and limits) today. With such information in hand, we can keep advancing humanity by collaborating with these incredible technologies.</p>
